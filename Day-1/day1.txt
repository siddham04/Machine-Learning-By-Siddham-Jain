 History of ML

- In 1764, `Thomas bayes` started this new technology by giving his `foundatitions on statistics`
- In 1842, `Ada Lovelace` gave his `foundations on algorithm`.
- In 1847, `George Boole` gave `Boolean Logic`.
- In 1936, `Alan Turing` proposed a machine that can learn.
- In 1952, `Arthur Samuel` created the first computer programme at `IBM.`
- In 1959, `MADALINE` - the first `artificial neural networ`k was invented.
- In 2006, `Geoffrey Hinton` invents the term `Deep Learning`.
- In 2016, `AlphaGo` was the first machine which defeated the human player in the famous game `GO`.
